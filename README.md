First you will need to enter the directory to a folder in your desktop which has all images of yourself. Make sure the images contain straight face, ideally with no one else in the background.

1. Click on "Enter File"
2. Then enter the directory to your folder with images of everyone you want to "whitelist" 
3. Click on "Enter Mail" and enter the email address where you want to be alerted when someone not "whitelisted" enters the room (email may be sent to spam section)

Then the program will automatically start running! If you want to change settings at any point, press 'Ctrl' + 'q'.

Note that due to changes in Gmail settings, the mail sending feature may not work as expected.
